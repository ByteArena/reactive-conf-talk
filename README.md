### Byte Arena: Digital Playground for Intelligent Agents

Code your autonomous agent and live watch it challenge other players AIs in deathmatch arenas, CTF maps or in physically realistic race simulations.

Your agent is a program that perceives its digital environment, makes decisions, and takes actions to reach its objectives. Tweak it, evolve it, refine it, script it, make it learn â€” whatever works; one goal : overcome the opponents with your code.

Perceive your environment and react accordingly!
